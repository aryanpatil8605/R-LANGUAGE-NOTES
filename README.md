## 2. Basics of R and Loading Data into R

### 2.1 Getting Started with R

#### Installing R
Download and install R from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/).

#### Using R
Start RStudio and begin writing R scripts or use the R console for interactive commands.

#### Creating and Using Vectors
```r
# Creating a vector
vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)  # The c() function combines values into a vector
print(vec)  # Prints the vector
```

#### Creating Data Frames
```r
# Creating a data frame
df <- data.frame(name = c("John", "Doe"), age = c(25, 30))  # Creates a data frame with two columns: name and age
print(df)  # Prints the data frame
```

#### Exploring Data Frames
```r
# Exploring a data frame
str(df)  # Displays the structure of the data frame, including data types of each column
summary(df)  # Provides summary statistics for each column in the data frame
```

#### Accessing Columns in a Data Frame
```r
# Accessing a column
df$name  # Accesses the 'name' column of the data frame
```

#### Reading a CSV Text File
```r
# Reading a CSV file
df <- read.csv("file.csv")  # Reads a CSV file and stores it in a data frame
```

#### Removing Rows and Columns
```r
# Removing a row
df <- df[-1, ]  # Removes the first row of the data frame

# Removing a column
df <- df[, -1]  # Removes the first column of the data frame
```

#### Renaming Rows and Columns
```r
# Renaming columns
names(df) <- c("First_Name", "Age")  # Renames the columns of the data frame
```

#### Sorting Data Frames
```r
# Sorting data frame by a column
df <- df[order(df$Age), ]  # Sorts the data frame by the 'Age' column in ascending order
```

#### Understanding Râ€™s Data Frame Structure
Data frames are 2-dimensional data structures in R, similar to tables in a database.

### 2.2 Working with Data from Files

#### Working with Well-Structured Data from Files or URLs
```r
# Reading data from a URL
df <- read.csv("https://example.com/data.csv")  # Reads a CSV file from a URL and stores it in a data frame
```

#### Using R on Less-Structured Data
```r
# Reading data with irregular structures
data <- readLines("unstructured_data.txt")  # Reads text data line by line and stores it in a vector
```

#### Working with Relational Databases
```r
# Connecting to a database
library(RSQLite)  # Loads the RSQLite package
conn <- dbConnect(SQLite(), "database.sqlite")  # Connects to a SQLite database

# Loading data from a database
df <- dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM table_name")  # Executes a SQL query and stores the result in a data frame
```

#### Working with the PUMS Data
Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data can be loaded and analyzed in R using similar techniques as above.

## 3. Working with RStudio, Exploring Data, and Managing Data

### 3.1 Onward with RStudio

#### Creating R Scripts
Create R scripts (.R files) to write and save your R code for reuse.

#### Creating Functions using R
```r
# Creating a function
my_function <- function(x, y) {  # Defines a function named 'my_function' with two parameters: x and y
  return(x + y)  # Returns the sum of x and y
}
print(my_function(3, 4))  # Calls the function with arguments 3 and 4 and prints the result
```

#### Testing Functions
Ensure your functions work correctly by testing them with various inputs.

### Exploring Data

#### Using Summary Statistics to Spot Problems
```r
# Summary statistics
summary(df)  # Provides summary statistics for each column in the data frame
```

### Managing Data

#### Cleaning Data
```r
# Treating missing values
df[is.na(df)] <- 0  # Replaces all NA (missing) values in the data frame with 0
```

#### Data Transformations
```r
# Log transformation
df$log_age <- log(df$Age)  # Adds a new column 'log_age' which is the natural logarithm of the 'Age' column
```

#### Sampling for Modeling and Validation
```r
# Creating training and test splits
set.seed(123)  # Sets the seed for random number generation to ensure reproducibility
train_index <- sample(seq_len(nrow(df)), size = 0.7 * nrow(df))  # Creates a random sample of 70% of the data
train_df <- df[train_index, ]  # Subsets the data frame to create the training set
test_df <- df[-train_index, ]  # Subsets the data frame to create the test set
```

## 4. Modeling Methods

### 4.1 Choosing and Evaluating Models

#### Mapping Business Problems to Machine Learning Tasks
- **Classification**: Predicting categorical labels.
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values.
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar items.

#### Evaluating Models
```r
# Evaluating a classification model
library(caret)  # Loads the caret package for model training and evaluation
model <- train(name ~ ., data = train_df, method = "rf")  # Trains a random forest model to predict 'name' based on other columns
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test_df)  # Uses the model to make predictions on the test set
confusionMatrix(predictions, test_df$name)  # Creates a confusion matrix to evaluate the classification performance
```

### 4.2 Evaluating Different Types of Models

#### Evaluating Probability Models
Assess models that provide probability estimates.

#### Evaluating Ranking Models
Assess models that rank items or users.

#### Evaluating Clustering Models
Assess models that group similar items together.

### Validating Models

#### Identifying Common Model Problems
- Overfitting: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on test data.
- Underfitting: When a model performs poorly on both training and test data.

#### Quantifying Model Soundness
Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate model performance.

#### Ensuring Model Quality
Regularly monitor and update models to maintain their effectiveness.

## Example Workflow

### Load Data
```r
df <- read.csv("data.csv")  # Reads a CSV file and stores it in a data frame
```

### Explore Data
```r
summary(df)  # Provides summary statistics for each column in the data frame
```

### Clean Data
```r
df <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(age))  # Filters out rows with missing values in the 'age' column
```

### Analyze Data
```r
model <- lm(age ~ name, data = df)  # Fits a linear model to predict 'age' based on 'name'
summary(model)  # Provides a summary of the fitted model
```

### Visualize Data
```r
library(ggplot2)  # Loads the ggplot2 package for data visualization
ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = name)) + geom_point()  # Creates a scatter plot of 'age' vs 'name'
```

### Report Results
```markdown
---
title: "Analysis Report"
output: html_document
---

```{r}
summary(df)  # Provides summary statistics for each column in the data frame
ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = name)) + geom_point()  # Creates a scatter plot of 'age' vs 'name'
```
```
